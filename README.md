# testaccelerator
This project became commercially viable test accelerator framework.

To create this project I had to learn:
* Annotations
* Reflection
* TestNG runner capabilities

The code is capable of running local and remote web drivers, mobile devices/simulators and connecting with BrowserStack, SauceLabs and related services.
